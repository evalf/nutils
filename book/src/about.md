# About Nutils

Nutils is a Free and [Open Source](https://github.com/evalf/nutils/) Python
programming library for Finite Element Method computations, developed by
[Evalf](https://evalf.com/) and distributed under the permissive MIT license.
Key features are a readable, math centric syntax, an object oriented design,
strict separation of topology and geometry, and high level function
manipulations with support for automatic differentiation.

Nutils provides the tools required to construct a typical simulation workflow
in just a few lines of Python code, while at the same time leaving full
flexibility to build novel workflows or interact with third party tools. With
native support for Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), the Finite Cell method (FCM),
multi-physics, mixed methods, and hierarchical refinement, Nutils is at the
forefront of numerical discretization science. Efficient under-the-hood
vectorization and built-in parallellisation provide for an effortless
transition from academic research projects to full scale, real world
applications.

Nutils is actively used in a wide range of research, studying both novel
physics as well as numerical techniques. If you are using Nutils in your
research, please consider [citing
