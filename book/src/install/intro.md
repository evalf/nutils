# Installation

Nutils requires a working installation of Python 3.5 or higher. Many different
installers exist and there are no known issues with any of them. When in doubt
about which to use, a safe option is to go with the [official
installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/). From there on Nutils can be
installed following the steps below.

Depending on your system the Python executable may be installed as either
`python` or `python3`, or both, not to mention alternative implementations such
as `pypy` or `pyston`. In the following instructions, `python` is to be
replaced with the relevant executable name.
