# New in Nutils 4 "eliche"

- [Nutils 4.1](https://github.com/evalf/nutils/releases/tag/v4.1) was released on August 28th, 2018
- [Nutils 4.0](https://github.com/evalf/nutils/releases/tag/v4.0) was released on June 11th, 2019

## Spline basis continuity argument

In addition to the `knotmultiplicities` argument to define the
continuity of basis function on structured topologies, the
`nutils.topology.Topology.basis` method now supports the
`continuity` argument to define the global continuity of basis
functions. With negative numbers counting backwards from the
`degree`, the default value of `-1` corresponds to a knot
multiplicity of 1.

## Eval arguments

Functions of type `nutils.function.Evaluable` can receive
arguments in addition to element and points by depending on instances
of `nutils.function.Argument` and having their values specified
via `nutils.sample.Sample.eval`:

```python
f = geom.dot(function.Argument('myarg', shape=geom.shape))
f = 'x_i ?myarg_i' @ ns # equivalent operation in namespace
topo.sample('uniform', 1).eval(f, myarg=numpy.ones(geom.shape))
```

## The d:-operator

Namespace expression syntax now includes the `d:` Jacobian operator,
allowing one to write `'d:x' @ ns` instead of `function.J(ns.x)`.
Since including the Jacobian in the integrand is preferred over
specifying it separately, the `geometry` argument of
`nutils.topology.Topology.integrate` is deprecated:

```python
topo.integrate(ns.f, geometry=ns.x) # deprecated
topo.integrate(ns.f * function.J(ns.x)) # was and remains valid
topo.integrate('f d:x' @ ns) # new namespace syntax
```

## Truncated hierarchical bsplines

Hierarchically refined topologies now support basis truncation, which
reduces the supports of individual basis functions while maintaining
the spanned space. To select between truncated and non-truncated the
basis type must be prefixed with 'th-' or 'h-', respectively. A
non-prefixed basis type falls back on the default implementation that
fails on all types but discont:

```python
htopo.basis('spline', degree=2) # no longer valid
htopo.basis('h-spline', degree=2) # new syntax for original basis
htopo.basis('th-spline', degree=2) # new syntax for truncated basis
htopo.basis('discont', degree=2) # still valid
```

## Transparent function cache

The `nutils.cache` module provides a memoizing function decorator
`nutils.cache.function` which reads return values from cache in
case a set of function arguments has been seen before. It is similar
in function to Python's `functools.lru_cache`, except that the cache
is maintained on disk and `nutils.types.nutils_hash` is used to
compare arguments, which means that arguments need not be Python
hashable. The mechanism is activated via `nutils.cache.enable`:

```python
@cache.function
def f(x):
  return x * 2

with cache.enable():
  f(10)
```

If `nutils.cli.run` is used then the cache can also be enabled
via the new `--cache` command line argument. With many internal
Nutils functions already decorated, including all methods in the
`nutils.solver` module, transparent caching is available out of
the box with no further action required.

## New module: types

The new `nutils.types` module unifies and extends components
relating to object types. The following preexisting objects have been
moved to the new location:

- `util.enforcetypes` → `types.apply_annotations`
- `util.frozendict` → `types.frozendict`
- `numeric.const` → `types.frozenarray`

## MKL matrix, Pardiso solver

The new `MKL` backend generates matrices that are powered by Intel's Math
Kernel Library, which notably includes the reputable Pardiso solver. This
requires `libmkl` to be installed, which is conveniently available through
pip:

```sh
pip install mkl
```

When `nutils.cli.run` is used the new matrix type is selected
automatically if it is available, or manually using `--matrix=MKL`.

## Nonlinear minimization

For problems that adhere to an energy structure, the new solver method
`nutils.solver.minimize` provides an alternative mechanism that
exploits this structure to robustly find the energy minimum:

```python
res = sqr.derivative('dofs')
solver.newton('dofs', res, ...)
solver.minimize('dofs', sqr, ...) # equivalent
```

## Data packing

Two new methods, `nutils.numeric.pack` and its inverse
`nutils.numeric.unpack`, provide lossy compression to floating
point data. Primarily useful for regression tests, the convenience
method `numeric.assert_allclose64` combines data packing with zlib
compression and base64 encoding for inclusion in Python codes.
