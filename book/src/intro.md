# How to Read This Book

Since Nutils is a library for the development of numerical simulations, this
book assumes that the reader is familiar with differential calculus, Galerkin
methods, and the Finite Element Method. If this is not the case, chances are
that Nutils is not the tool they are looking for.

First time users who are eager to get their feet wet will want to begin with
the [getting started guide](start.md) and build a functioning Poisson solver in
three easy steps, no questions asked. Following this, beginners are strongly
advised to follow the hands on [tutorial](tutorial/intro.md) to gain an an
in-depth understanding of Nutils' concepts and get familiar with the syntax.

Novices and advanced users alike may find interest in the [installation
guide](install/intro.md]), which ranges from basic installation instructions to
tips and tricks for optimizing the installation, instructions for running a
Docker style container, and suggestions for computing remotely.

Anybody looking to build their own Nutils simulations are encouraged to browse
through projects in the [examples section](examples.md). Most simulations will
have components in common with existing scripts, so a mix-and-match approach is
a good way to start building your own. In case questions do remain, the
[support page](support.md) lists ways of getting in touch with developers.

Finally, an exhaustive overview of all Nutils objects and functions can be
found in the [API Reference](api.md).
