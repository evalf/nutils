Changelog
=========

Nutils is under active development and the API is not frozen. Active
users are advised to keep an eye on this file to stay up to date with
the most prominent user-facing changes.


Changed: pariter, parmap

  The parellel.pariter and parellel.parmap functions now require the
  desired number of processors to be explicitly requested through the
  'nprocs' argument. The parallel.shzeros function always returns an
  shared memory regardless of the value of the global nprocs property,
  which is no longer referenced in the parallel module.


New: topology.with{subdomain,boundary,interfaces,points}

  Topologies have been made fully immutable, which means that the old
  setitem operation is no longer supported. Instead, to add a
  subtopology to the domain, its boundary, its interfaces, or points,
  any of the methods .withsubdomain, .withboundary, .withinterfaces, and
  .withpoints, respectively, will return a copy of the topology with the
  desired groups added.

  Removed syntax:
  >> domain.boundary['wall'] = domain.boundary['left,top']

  New:
  >> domain = domain.withboundary( wall=domain.boundary['left,top'] )
  >> domain.boundary['wall'].integrate( ... )

  Alternative:
  >> domain = domain.withboundary( wall='left,top' )


New: circular symmetry

  Any topology can be revolved using the new .revolved method, which
  interprets the first geometry dimension as a radius and replaces it by
  two new dimensions, shifting the remaining axes backward. In addition
  to the modified topology and geometry, simplifying function is
  returned as the third return value which replaces all occurrences of
  the revolution angle by zero. This should only be used after all
  gradients have been computed, typically in integrate or elem_eval.

  >> rdomain, rgeom, simplify = domain.revolved( geom )
  >> basis = rdomain.basis( 'spline', degree=2 )
  >> M = function.outer( basis.grad(rgeom) ).sum(-1)
  >> rdomain.integrate(M, geometry=rgeom, ischeme='gauss2', edit=simplify)


Changed: supp

  The function.supp convenience function to find the supporting elements
  of certain basis vectors has been deprecated. In its place is the much
  more robust Topology.supp method, which search for supporting elements
  within a topology. In addition to this the selection can be made as an
  index vector or boolean mask, as in the following typical example:

  >> v = domain.integrate(basis*coeffs, geometry=geom, ischeme='gauss2')
  >> supp = domain.supp( basis, abs(v) > threshold )
  >> domain.refined_by( supp )


Removed: pointdata

  The deprecated function.Pointdata is removed. The replacing
  construction is Topology.elem_eval with the asfunction=True argument:

  >>> f_pnt = domain.elem_eval( f, ischeme='gauss2', asfunction=True )
  >>> domain.integrate( f - f_pnt, geometry=geom, ischeme='gauss2' ) == 0


Changed: renamed mesh.gmesh to mesh.gmsh; added support for periodicy

  The gmsh importer was unintentionally misnamed as gmesh; this has been
  fixed. With that the old name is deprecated and will be removed in
  future. In addition, support for the non-physical mesh format and
  externally supplied boundary labels has been removed (see the unit
  test tests/mesh.py for examples of valid .geo format). Support is
  added for periodicity and interface groups.


Changed: function.Inflate, function.DofMap; removed IntVector

  The Inflate class takes a new length argument for the inflated shape.
  The dofmap argument is now a generic int-array function, which removes
  the need for a separate IntVector object; DofMap now derives directly
  from Array.


Changed: renamed ElemFunc to LocalCoords

  Besides the name change the new object is derived from
  DerivativeTargetBase so that it can be used as a derivate target,
  removing the need for a 'localcoords' special token.


Changed: function.asarray

  Formerly asarray returned non-evaluable objects as numpy arrays. The
  new implementation always returns a nutils Array, wrapping constant
  objects in function.Constant.


New: function.Constant

  Wrapper object that returns a numpy array through evalf, introducing a
  singleton point axis at location 0.


New: function.Array with dtype; deprecates function.ArrayFunc

  ArrayFunc is deprecated and will be removed. The new Array base class
  is identical to ArrayFunc except for the mandatory argument 'dtype',
  which takes a value of float, int, or bool.
