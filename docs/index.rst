Welcome to Nutils's documentation!
==================================

Nutils: open source numerical utilities for Python, is a collaborative
programming effort aimed at the creation of a modern, general purpose
programming library for `Finite Element
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method>`_ applications and
related computational methods. Identifying features are a heavily object
oriented design, strict separation of topology and geometry, and CAS-like
function arithmetic such as found in Maple and Mathematica. Primary design
goals are:

  * **Readability**. Finite element scripts built on top of Nutils should focus
    on work flow and maths, unobscured by Finite Element infrastructure.
  * **Flexibility**. The Nutils are tools; they do not enforce a strict work
    flow. Missing components can be added locally without loosing
    interoperability.
  * **Compatibility**. Exposed objects are of native python type or allow for
    easy conversion to leverage third party tools.
  * **Speed**. Nutils are self-optimizing and support parallel computation.
    Typical scripting inefficiencies are discouraged by design.
