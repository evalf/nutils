Nutils API Reference
====================

Nutils is subdivided in a great number of logical units. Some of these are
directly user facing, such as :mod:`nutils.cli`, :mod:`nutils.mesh` and
:mod:`nutils.export`. Others are primarily used internally, such as
:mod:`nutils.types`, :mod:`nutils.points` and :mod:`nutils.transform`. However,
a strict separation does not exist, and which modules are accessed directly
depends entirely on the specifics of the application.

The modules are:

   :glob:

   nutils/*
