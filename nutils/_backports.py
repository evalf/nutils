"""
The backports module provides minimal fallback implementations for functions
that are introduced in versions of Python that are newer than the minimum
required version. Function behavour is equal to its Python counterpart only to
the extent that the Nutils code base requires it to be. As such,
implementations found in this module should not be relied upon as general
drop-on replacements.
